Coding challenge - Manage tasks

You have been asked to develop a to-do list application that allows the user to create and manage tasks. The application has the following features:
• Add and view tasks
• Delete a task
• Complete a task
• Set a priority for my tasks
• View the tasks sorted by priority and name
• View the number of total and completed tasks

Instructions:

Please provide the relevant source code of your implementation, any documentation, and additional assumptions that you feel are appropriate.

Please use the following information to assist you with completing the challenge successfully:
• The intent of the challenge is to provide us with an opportunity to judge your problem-solving, design, and development skills. It is important to provide a solution that highlights your skills in these areas.
• Develop the system using Typescript (preferable), or Javascript
• If you prefer to use a framework, consider NextJS v14 or newer
• You may use a UI library such as ShadcnUI or RadixUI
• Ensure you have a good understanding of how these UI toolkits work.
• You may be asked to modify a component by hand
• Save the data to an SQLite database using local/session storage (such as IndexedDB)
• Your solution should be high quality and well-annotated
• The simplest solution is often the best
• Be mindful of the use of AI, you may be asked to modify the solution in a live interview, so you need to ensure you know how everything works, and could make changes by hand as needed.
• During a session such as this, you would have free access to any online resource. We want to see how you think.

Try to make the solution mobile-responsive, if you can.
